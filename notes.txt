For Security reasons,Aws and third-parties  do not enable external access by defaut...
AWS controls any interaction between K8s objects and services in its ecosystem witha strong access control method...
Only K8s objects with  right permissions can make API calls to services outside the K8s ecosystem...

There are 3 differents ways of granting K8S objects access to external services:
                - RBAC(role-based access control)
                - IRSA( IAM role for service account)
                - pOD IDENTITY Method

RBAC:
    In kubernetes < 1.30 ,Pods will inherit the IAM role of the worker node(EC2 instance) if IRSA is not configured...
    [ example: if you did not configure IRSA and your worker node IAM role has full access to s3...
               Then pods will inherit those permissions and will  be able to access S3 without needing credentials or IRSA setup... ] 

    [ This access mode poses significant security risk to the cluster as an attacker could exploit application vulnerability
      to potentially gain unauthorized access to bot the cluster and other resources outside the cluster...
      To mitigate this risk , it is essential to implemenet strict Security Policies like:
                  - Pod Security Policies
                  - hop limit of the instance metadata service version2(IMDSv2)
                  - IP tables
                  - Network Policies
                  - update kubernetes to version > or = to 1.30]
