                                    =================================

1. What It Does
---------------
        - Enables service-to-service connectivity across VPCs, accounts, and compute types.
        - Provides Layer 7 (HTTP/HTTPS) routing.
        - Offers built-in IAM-based security and TLS termination.
        - Works with ECS, EKS, EC2, Lambda.

2. Core Components
------------------
        - Service Network: Logical grouping of services for discovery/routing.
        - Services: Your microservices or applications.
        - Targets: Actual compute resources (EC2, ECS, Lambda, etc.).
        - Auth Policy: IAM-based access control for service access.
        - Listeners & Rules: Define how traffic is routed.

3. How It Works
---------------
        - Define a service network and register services.
        - Attach services to VPCs (not subnets/IPs).
        - Routing and discovery managed by Lattice DNS.
        - Clients resolve DNS and VPC Lattice routes requests internally.

4. Security
-----------
        - IAM-based service access control.
        - TLS termination at the edge of service network.
        - No complex security groups or network rules required.

5. Use Cases
------------
        - Communication across VPCs/accounts.
        - Hybrid service meshes (EKS + Lambda/EC2).
        - Centralized traffic control with IAM auth.
        - Simplified service discovery without Transit Gateway.

6. What It’s NOT
----------------
        - Not a full mesh like App Mesh (no sidecars).
        - Not a replacement for API Gateway or ALB for internet-facing traffic.
        - Doesn’t use mutual TLS or advanced service proxying.

7. Integration with EKS
-----------------------
        - Use AWS VPC Lattice controller.
        - Services registered from Kubernetes via CRDs.
        - Can complement or simplify App Mesh setups.

8. Considerations
-----------------
        - Costs based on requests, data processing, and service network uptime.
        - Ensure region availability.
        - Requires IAM setup and proper controller installation for EKS.
