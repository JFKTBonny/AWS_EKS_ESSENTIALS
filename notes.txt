#### The hybrid EKS cluster illustrates how both private and public endpoints can coexist in the same cluster...
     It makes possible to access the kubernetes API server  from both private and public networks...
     It is beneficial for a good mix of internal and external access requirements...
     for example for cluster security we need private endpoint access while an external service like jenkins CICD pipeline
     must access the cluster over public endpoint...

### Why do we need an hybrid cluster:
   Suppose you are running a jenkins server with a public ip 193.16.23.22...
   Suppose you want to restrict external access to jenkins server by blocking all other external access...
   You can do so by reconfiguring the endpoints...
   To make it happen,we can just uncomment the public_access_cidr arguments in eks.tf file and apply the change made..
   then only ip addresses included in the cidr block range can access the jenkins server..

###  useful commands to test a deployed eks cluster:
          - Check the permission of the cluster creator:             kubectl auth can-i list nodes
          - The general format:                                      kubectl auth can-i VERB [Type ➤ OBJECT NAME ➤RESOURCE]
          - Verify if the current user can perform all actions:      kubectl auth can-i "*" "*"
