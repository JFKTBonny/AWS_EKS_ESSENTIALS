###  CLUSTER AUTOSCALER and  KARPENTER are tools that can be use to scale a cluster infrastructure....
     They can automatically adjust the number of nodes in your BEKS cluster...
     They dynamically scale your cluster in response to changing demand while optimizing cost efficiency... 

     Cluster Autoscaler:
     ##################

CA and KARPENTER can dynamically increase the node capacity based on the demands of the pods,preventing pending pods
and making the cluster efficient in handing workloads...
    EKS provides 3 ways for automatically scaling node in order to schedule more pods based on demand:

          - Cluster Autoscaler(CA): adjust the number of nodes in your cluster...scale up or down the number of nodes based on resources utilisation...

          - VPA(Vertical Pod Autoscaler): adjust  automaticaly the CPU and MEMORY resources to running pods... 

          - HPA(Horizontal Pod Autoscaler): automatically scales the number of pods replicas based on metrics observation such as CPU and MEMORY usage...

In EKS ,CA depends on the AWS autoscaling group(ASG) to adjust nodes depending on resource demands...
