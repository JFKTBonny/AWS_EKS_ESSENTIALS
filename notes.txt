To update your kubeconfig file in order to access the cluster, run:
       aws eks update-kubeconfig --name public-endpoint-cluster
       aws eks describe-cluster --name public-endpoint-cluster

cluster security analysis for this case:
   The cluster creator is the only security layer protecting the cluster
   from compromise or unauthorized access...
   Anyone who gains access to the creator credentials can take over the cluster...

*** The current setup represents the lack of defense,as the cluster depends on a single security layer,
    (the cluster creator access and secret key)...
*** To enhance security:
          - configure a role with MFA and an external ID...
          - using aws roles to assign temporary credentials to the cluster creator is
          more secure than permanent access key ID and secret access key credentials...  

Public Endpoint Restrictions with  CLI command:

    aws eks update-cluster-config \
        --region region-code \
        --name public-endpoint-cluster \
        --resources-vpc-config endpointPublicAccess=true,
        publicAccessCidrs="MyIP/32"

MyIP: my public IP 

###################### Network security
            API calls between the data and the control planes of the cluster  should occur over
            a private network to minimize the attack surface...

            The cluster ENIs are responsible for transmitting traffic from the control plane to the data plane...
            ENIs must be deployed in private subnets to ensure that all or part of the API communication remains private
            and protected from external access..

    *** In production env, ENIs are ofyen deployed in their own subnets such that they do not coexist with the worker nodes...
    *** The ENIs subnets are often allocated the /28 CIDR block within the data plane VPC...
