‚úÖ Amazon EBS (Elastic Block Store):
        Type: Block storage

        Use Case: Persistent volumes for single pod access (e.g., databases)

        Behavior:

        One EBS volume = one pod at a time (can be reattached to another pod)

        Fast, low-latency

        Region & AZ specific (must be in same AZ as the pod)

‚úÖ Amazon EFS (Elastic File System):
        Type: Shared file storage

        Use Case: Volumes shared across multiple pods, even across nodes

        Behavior:

        Fully managed NFS file system

        Multi-AZ and multi-node access

        Good for content management, logs, shared resources

‚úÖ You‚Äôll typically need:
        Service Account in Kubernetes ‚Äì for the pod(s) needing access.

        IAM Role ‚Äì with the necessary AWS permissions.

        IRSA setup (IAM Role for Service Account) ‚Äì to map the service account to the IAM role.

        OIDC provider enabled in the EKS cluster ‚Äì to let AWS verify the service account‚Äôs identity.

üîÅ Common Addons that need this:
        aws-ebs-csi-driver

        aws-efs-csi-driver

        aws-load-balancer-controller

        external-dns

        cluster-autoscaler

        karpenter

        cert-manager (if using Route53 DNS validation)
