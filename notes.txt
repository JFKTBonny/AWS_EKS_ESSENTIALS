Istio Service Mesh Overview
===========================

What is Istio?
--------------
Istio is an open-source service mesh that enables secure, reliable, and observable communication between microservices. 
        It provides: 
                - traffic management
                - security
                - and observability without requiring changes to application code.

Core Components:
---------------
        1. Envoy Proxy: Sidecar proxy deployed with each pod to handle inbound/outbound traffic.

        2. Istiod: Control plane that manages configuration and service discovery.

        3. Ingress Gateway: Handles incoming traffic to the mesh.
        
        4. Egress Gateway: Manages outgoing traffic from the mesh.

        

Key Features:
------------
        - Traffic Management: 
                   1- Advanced routing (canary, A/B testing), 
                   2- fault injection
                   3- retries
                   4- timeouts.

        - Security: 
                   1- Mutual TLS
                   2- policy enforcement
                   3- identity-based authentication.

        - Observability: 
                   1- Metrics
                   2- logs
                   3- and tracing via Prometheus, Grafana, Jaeger, Kiali.

        - Extensibility: 
                   1- EnvoyFilters 
                   2- and Wasm plugins.



Important CRDs (Custom Resource Definitions):
-------------------------------------------
        - VirtualService: Defines routing rules for traffic.

        - DestinationRule: Configures policies for a service (like TLS settings).

        - Gateway: Controls ingress/egress.

        - ServiceEntry: Adds external services to the mesh.

        - PeerAuthentication: Defines mTLS modes.

        - AuthorizationPolicy: Manages access control.

Installation Step:
------------------
        1. Create Kubernetes cluster.

        2. Install Istio using:
                - istioctl
                - Helm, or Operator.
        3. Label namespace for sidecar injection: kubectl label namespace default istio-injection=enabled
                
        4. Deploy services.

        5. Define routing and security policies using CRDs.

Best Practices
--------------
        - Start in non-production environments.
        - Enable observability tools early.
        - Use separate VirtualServices for route groups.
        - Monitor proxy resource usage.
        - Apply security principles early (e.g., mTLS, RBAC).

Helpful Tools
-------------
        - Kiali: Visualizes service mesh topology.
        - Prometheus/Grafana: Metrics and dashboards.
        - Jaeger: Tracing.
        - istioctl analyze: Validates configuration.

Security Features
-----------------
        - Automatic certificate/key rotation.
        - Fine-grained access control.
        - Restrict external traffic via ServiceEntry.
        - Secure communication via mTLS.
