#### EKS Describe Cluster Policy:
   An AWS administrator need the describe policy to create and administer EKS cluster...
   he can't execute certain commands if he can not describe the cluster...
   AWS does not include this permission in the IAM administrator policy by default...
   He must create a custom policy that includes it and then attach that policy to the cluster administrator...


NB: The -o IdentitiesOnly=yes flag is used with SSH-based commands like ssh or scp to ensure that 
    only the identity file specified with the -i option is used for authentication.

    By default, the SSH client may attempt to use all available identities loaded in the SSH agent, 
    which can lead to a "Too many authentication failures" error if the server disconnects after a 
    certain number of failed attempts.

    Adding -o IdentitiesOnly=yes tells the client to ignore other
    identities and only try the one explicitly provided, ensuring 
    a more reliable and direct connection to the server...
