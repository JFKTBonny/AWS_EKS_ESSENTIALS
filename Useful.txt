The Istio ingress gateway provides external access to the apps running inside your EKS cluster.

### What the Ingress Gateway Does:
The istio-ingressgateway is a LoadBalancer service managed by Istio that acts as the entry point into the service mesh. 
It is responsible for:

            1- Receiving incoming traffic from outside the cluster
            2- Matching requests based on Gateway and VirtualService rules
            3-  Routing traffic to the appropriate backend services (like blue, green)
            4- Enabling advanced features like traffic splitting, TLS termination, retries, mirroring, etc.

### How It Works with Your YAMLs:
        - The Gateway resource defines where and how traffic enters (e.g., port 80, all hosts).

        - The VirtualService defines how that traffic is routed (e.g., 50% to blue, 50% to green).

        Together, they instruct the ingress gateway to: [Accept HTTP traffic on port 80 from any host, and route it based on defined rules.]

        

### Visual Flow:

                    Client (Browser or curl)
                            |
                            v
                    +----------------------+
                    | istio-ingressgateway |   <-- External LoadBalancer (port 80)
                    +----------------------+
                            |
                            v
                    +-----------------------------+
                    | VirtualService (Routing)   |
                    +-----------------------------+
                            |           |
                            v           v
                        Service:      Service:
                        green          blue


### To Access It:
You just need to get the external IP of the ingress gateway: [ kubectl get svc istio-ingressgateway -n istio-system ]

Then open your browser or run: [ curl http://<EXTERNAL-IP>/ ]
